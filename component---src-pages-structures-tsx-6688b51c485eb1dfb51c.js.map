He set about greatly enlarging the house which\n\t\t\the named Monte Rosa. It would later be renamed Neptune Lodge by James Kerfoot Maddux (1853-1930) who\n\t\t\tpurchased the property in September, 1895. Maddux in his own right was also a prominent member of the\n\t\t\tWarrenton community. Mr. Maddux renamed the property in honor of one of his racehorses. The original\n\t\t\tproperty was located in the southern portion of the Town of Warrenton, with parts of it extending outside of\n\t\t\tthe town’s limits. It included the Governor’s mansion, stables, an assortment of other farm related\n\t\t\tstructures and approximately 220 acres of fields and woods. Today the property is in the heart of the\n\t\t\tHistoric district of Warrenton and includes approximately seven acres of land consisting of the Governor’s\n\t\t\tmansion, stables, Extra Billy’s “office building”.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMonte Rosa is a notable historic home for multiple reasons:<br />\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was built by a prominent attorney, a member of the House of Representatives and the two time and\n\t\t\t\t\tCivil War Governor of Virginia;\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe house was originally built in an architecturally significant Italianate style and later\n\t\t\t\t\tconverted to a Colonial style; while the large brick stables were and remain in the Italianate\n\t\t\t\t\tstyle’;\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>The property was used to operate US mail routes critical to a growing nation;</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe property hosted and served as a command center by both Union and Confederate forces throughout\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Civil War;\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tWilliam “Extra Billy” Smith was a prominent Virginian and national figure and notable dignitaries of\n\t\t\t\t\this time visited and worked from the property.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Town of Warrenton was incorporated on January 5, 1810 and named for General Joseph Warren, a\n\t\t\tRevolutionary War hero. After a land grant from Richard Henry Lee, it became the Fauquier County seat. The\n\t\t\toriginal house was constructed about 1847–1848 on the south side of Warrenton. It is three story, brick and\n\t\t\tstucco structure and approximately 5,848 sq. ft. The house has a slate gable roof and side-passage floor\n\t\t\tplan. In the back of the main structure is a copper roof covered promenade that leads to a two-story brick\n\t\t\tsmoke house. The house has sustained several periods of alteration. It was originally built in the\n\t\t\tItalianate architectural style with a sweeping front steps leading to the front door on the second floor.\n\t\t\tToday it now manifests the proportions and details of the Colonial Revival style with the main entrance now\n\t\t\tbeing on the ground level. Also on the property is an architecturally significant Italianate style brick\n\t\t\tstable (c. 1847) also built by Extra Billy to house his U.S. postal service; the aforementioned two-story\n\t\t\tbrick smokehouse; and a two-story single-pile dwelling that dates from the late-19th century and is known as\n\t\t\tExtra Billy’s Office.\n\t\t\t<div>Picture 1 here</div>\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<Link to=\"/\">Go back to the homepage</Link>\n\t</>\n);\n\nexport default Structures;\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n\t{\n\t\tsite {\n\t\t\tbuildTime(formatString: \"YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm a z\")\n\t\t}\n\t}\n`;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
