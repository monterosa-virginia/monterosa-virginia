Maddux in his own right was also a prominent member of the Warrenton community. Mr. Maddux renamed the property in honor of one of his racehorses. The original property was located in the southern portion of the Town of Warrenton, with parts of it extending outside of the town’s limits. It included the Governor’s mansion, stables, an assortment of other farm related structures and approximately 220 acres of fields and woods.

It is three story, brick and stucco structure and approximately 5,848 sq. ft. The house has a slate gable roof and side-passage floor plan. In the back of the main structure is a copper roof covered promenade that leads to a two-story brick smoke house. The house has sustained several periods of alteration. It was originally built in the Italianate architectural style with a sweeping front steps leading to the front door on the second floor. Today it now manifests the proportions and details of the Colonial Revival style with the main entrance now being on the ground level. Also on the property is an architecturally significant Italianate style brick stable (c. 1847) also built by Extra Billy to house his U.S. postal service; the aforementioned two-story brick smokehouse; and a two-story single-pile dwelling that dates from the late-19th century and is known as Extra Billy’s Office."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"faca67e56e71","_type":"image","asset":{"_id":"image-1811fff8457901e0893db48524a05be8763a5fcb-372x231-jpg","_type":"sanity.imageAsset","_rev":"MZ5ftYniGNKTXADXt8RspD","_createdAt":"2020-11-26T07:24:45Z","_updatedAt":"2020-11-26T07:24:45Z","assetId":"1811fff8457901e0893db48524a05be8763a5fcb","extension":"jpg","metadata":{"_type":"sanity.imageMetadata","dimensions":{"_type":"sanity.imageDimensions","aspectRatio":1.6103896103896105,"height":231,"width":372},"hasAlpha":false,"isOpaque":true,"lqip":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","palette":{"_type":"sanity.imagePalette","darkMuted":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#444444","foreground":"#fff","population":4.4,"title":"#fff"},"darkVibrant":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#424242","foreground":"#fff","population":0,"title":"#fff"},"dominant":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#878787","foreground":"#fff","population":4.99,"title":"#fff"},"lightMuted":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#bcbcbc","foreground":"#000","population":1.9,"title":"#fff"},"lightVibrant":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#bcbcbc","foreground":"#000","population":0,"title":"#fff"},"muted":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#878787","foreground":"#fff","population":4.99,"title":"#fff"},"vibrant":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#7f7f7f","foreground":"#fff","population":0,"title":"#fff"}}},"mimeType":"image/jpeg","originalFilename":"monterosa-1.jpg","path":"images/c2zb4c1w/production/1811fff8457901e0893db48524a05be8763a5fcb-372x231.jpg","sha1hash":"1811fff8457901e0893db48524a05be8763a5fcb","size":42075,"uploadId":"1JcvI9NUW26Scx5nEBjOvmi0MKEy8Mct","url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/c2zb4c1w/production/1811fff8457901e0893db48524a05be8763a5fcb-372x231.jpg","id":"image-1811fff8457901e0893db48524a05be8763a5fcb-372x231-jpg","parent":null,"children":["e3659de3-457f-5294-8ad8-5f3fe4f11779"],"internal":{"type":"SanityImageAsset","contentDigest":"90f30a628162d2e7c7f19e3852977433","counter":38,"owner":"gatsby-source-sanity"}}},{"_key":"037792202da7","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"0971e9723035","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"ea83e7ac6696","_type":"image"},{"_key":"88a214dd4fe1","_type":"image"},{"_key":"293bca31e807","_type":"image"},{"_key":"17bb52045f4e","_type":"image"}],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"dd1253c90cd9","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"9663600006a8","_type":"span","marks":["9dc80093c442"],"text":"The original house was built in the Italianate style in the 1840s, as shown (to the left) in a promotional brochure produced for the failed South Warrenton development project.

Often Extra Billy’s business and political work required him to be gone for extended periods of time. While away, Elizabeth Smith saw to the day-to-day running of the property and his estate. The large Italianate brick barn Extra Billy built to the rear of the property housed his postal route horses and equipment, while a separate standalone building, still on the property, served as his office. Monte Rosa is historically significant due to its nexus to national and state politics and governance, 19th century modes of communication through his postal service routes, the Civil War and its architecture. Because of its central geographic location, often Monte Rosa served as the hub to numerous Civil War battles that occurred all around. Moreover in addition to Governor Smith and all of the politicians he hosted while in residence, the house hosted countless other prominent figures during the Civil War that included, amongst others, Major General Pleasanton, General Lee, Brigadier General Custer, General James McDowell and President’s Polk and Pierce (see Section 3.4)."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"3034afea24e9","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"3a16f8befbd80","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"34265c79fb46","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"175a8c93b2980","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"During the Civil War, Warrenton changed hands 67 times, second only to Winchester, Virginia, but after 1862 it was primarily in Federal hands, with the nearby Rappahannock River serving as the dividing line between the forces.
