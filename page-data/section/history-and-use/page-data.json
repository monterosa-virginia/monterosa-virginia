It was the administration of President Andrew Jackson that awarded Smith with his first postal service contract to deliver mail between Washington, D.C., and Milledgeville, Georgia (then the Capital of Georgia). Ambitious, Smith grew that service by adding other mail routes, for which he charged “extra” postal fees.
