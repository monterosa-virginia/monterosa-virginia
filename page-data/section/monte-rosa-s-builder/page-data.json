Ambitious, Smith grew that service by adding other mail routes, for which he charged “extra” postal fees.

Polk was elected President on a platform of expanding U.S. territory in Oregon and Texas. He advocated manifest destiny and the expansion of the U.S. through negotiation or force, if necessary. In 1845 the U.S. annexed Texas, which provoked Mexico. Building on his expansionist doctrine, Polk sent U.S. Army troops to the area as well as a diplomatic mission to Mexico to “persuade” the negotiated sale of the territory. The presence of U.S. troops', by Polk’s design, was intended to inflame the situation and lure Mexico into starting a conflict. Polk sought an excuse to argue to Congress that a declaration of war was required. On April 25, 1846, the Mexican cavalry attacked and killed about a dozen U.S. soldiers that were in the disputed zone under the command of General Zachary Taylor. They then laid siege to an American fort along the Rio Grande.
