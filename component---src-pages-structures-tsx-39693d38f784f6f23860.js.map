He set about greatly enlarging the house which\n\t\t\the named Monte Rosa. It would later be renamed Neptune Lodge by James Kerfoot Maddux (1853-1930) who\n\t\t\tpurchased the property in September, 1895. Maddux in his own right was also a prominent member of the\n\t\t\tWarrenton community. Mr. Maddux renamed the property in honor of one of his racehorses. The original\n\t\t\tproperty was located in the southern portion of the Town of Warrenton, with parts of it extending outside of\n\t\t\tthe town’s limits. It included the Governor’s mansion, stables, an assortment of other farm related\n\t\t\tstructures and approximately 220 acres of fields and woods.
