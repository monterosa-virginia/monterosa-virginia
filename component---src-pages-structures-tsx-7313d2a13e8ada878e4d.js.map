He set about greatly enlarging the house which\n\t\t\the named Monte Rosa. It would later be renamed Neptune Lodge by James Kerfoot Maddux (1853-1930) who\n\t\t\tpurchased the property in September, 1895. Maddux in his own right was also a prominent member of the\n\t\t\tWarrenton community. Mr. Maddux renamed the property in honor of one of his racehorses. The original\n\t\t\tproperty was located in the southern portion of the Town of Warrenton, with parts of it extending outside of\n\t\t\tthe town’s limits. It included the Governor’s mansion, stables, an assortment of other farm related\n\t\t\tstructures and approximately 220 acres of fields and woods. Today the property is in the heart of the\n\t\t\tHistoric district of Warrenton and includes approximately seven acres of land consisting of the Governor’s\n\t\t\tmansion, stables, Extra Billy’s “office building”.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMonte Rosa is a notable historic home for multiple reasons:<br />\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was built by a prominent attorney, a member of the House of Representatives and the two time and\n\t\t\t\t\tCivil War Governor of Virginia;\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe house was originally built in an architecturally significant Italianate style and later\n\t\t\t\t\tconverted to a Colonial style; while the large brick stables were and remain in the Italianate\n\t\t\t\t\tstyle’;\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>The property was used to operate US mail routes critical to a growing nation;</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe property hosted and served as a command center by both Union and Confederate forces throughout\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Civil War;\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tWilliam “Extra Billy” Smith was a prominent Virginian and national figure and notable dignitaries of\n\t\t\t\t\this time visited and worked from the property.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Town of Warrenton was incorporated on January 5, 1810 and named for General Joseph Warren, a\n\t\t\tRevolutionary War hero. After a land grant from Richard Henry Lee, it became the Fauquier County seat. The\n\t\t\toriginal house was constructed about 1847–1848 on the south side of Warrenton. It is three story, brick and\n\t\t\tstucco structure and approximately 5,848 sq. ft. The house has a slate gable roof and side-passage floor\n\t\t\tplan. In the back of the main structure is a copper roof covered promenade that leads to a two-story brick\n\t\t\tsmoke house. The house has sustained several periods of alteration. \n      </p>\n      <p>It was originally built in the\n\t\t\tItalianate architectural style with a sweeping front steps leading to the front door on the second floor.\n\t\t\tToday it now manifests the proportions and details of the Colonial Revival style with the main entrance now\n\t\t\tbeing on the ground level. Also on the property is an architecturally significant Italianate style brick\n\t\t\tstable (c. 1847) also built by Extra Billy to house his U.S. postal service; the aforementioned two-story\n\t\t\tbrick smokehouse; and a two-story single-pile dwelling that dates from the late-19th century and is known as\n\t\t\tExtra Billy’s Office.\n      \n\t\t</p>\n      <div style={{ maxWidth: `300px`, marginBottom: `1.45rem`, align: `left` }}> \n      <figure>\n\t\t\t<FirstImage />\n      <figcaption>Original house built in the 1840's.</figcaption>\n      </figure>\n      </div>\n\n    <p>\n\t\t\t\n    The original house was built in the Italianate style in the 1840s, \n    as shown (above) in a promotional brochure produced for the failed South Warrenton development project.  \n    The original structure had a large ornate staircase that entered the house at the piano noble level (second floor). \n    The Smith Mansion became well known for stylish entertaining as both Elizabeth and William Smith were heralded as being\n    excellent hosts.  Many notable and prominent figures in his business and political world came to Monte Rosa.\n\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n    Substantive architectural modifications to the house, mostly completed by Maddux, change the appearance of the \n    structure to its current Colonial Revival style.  The entrance was moved to the first floor and a welcoming entrance \n    foyer with a crystal chandelier and stairway was established.  Also, a grand copper roof, two-story Doric portico over \n    the entrance at the front of the building was attached.  The inserted black and white photograph below shows the house \n    around Maddux’s ownership and after the noted architectural changes, while the color photograph below it \n    shows the house during the Macdonald’s tenure (1987 to current).\n\n    </p>\n    <div style={{ maxWidth: `300px`, marginBottom: `1.45rem` }}> \n      <figure>\n\t\t\t<Image />\n      <figcaption>The house around Maddux's ownership after architechural changes.</figcaption>\n      </figure>\n      </div>\n      <div style={{ maxWidth: `300px`, marginBottom: `1.45rem` }}> \n      <figure>\n\t\t\t<Image3 />\n      <figcaption>House during the Macdonald’s tenure (1987 to current)</figcaption>\n      </figure>\n      </div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>At the same time that Monte Rosa was being built,\nExtra Billy erected a large brick stable in a matching\nItalianate style and complete with a dominant central\ncupola. The Italianate style of architecture was\npopular to Smith as it was similar in style to Smith’s\nchildhood home Mt. Ecentric. The Stable is\nconsidered to be\na singular and\nexceptional example of a stable in this style in Virginia.\nThe brick stable (shown to the left) is built in four sections\nmeasuring 164 feet in length. It has a central three-bay\nsection with a pyramidal copper roofed cupola. A solid\nstone wall and slate roof horse barn was also constructed\nto the east of the main barn at some point. In 1991, the\nowners of Neptune Lodge, Michael and Kay Macdonald,\npromoted the listing of both the house and stable on the\nNational Register of Historic places.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\nPICS 4 and 5 (stable)\n\n<p>\n\tSmith and his society wife (married 1820), Elizabeth\nHansbrough Bell, had eleven children. The house was\ncentral to the Smith family, their businesses and was the\nbackdrop of State and National politics of the times. As a\nresult, it was his private residence as well as the\nheadquarters for his various business interests. Often\nExtra Billy’s business and political work required him to be\ngone for extended periods of time. While away, Elizabeth\nSmith saw to the day-to-day running of the property and his estate. The large Italianate brick\nbarn Extra Billy built to the rear of the property housed his postal route horses and equipment,\nwhile a separate standalone building, still on the property,\nserved as his office. Monte Rosa is historically significant\ndue to its nexus to national and state politics and\ngovernance, 19th century modes of communication\nthrough his postal service routes, the Civil War and its\narchitecture. Because of its central geographic location,\noften Monte Rosa served as the hub to numerous Civil War\nbattles that occurred all around. Moreover in addition to\nGovernor Smith and all of the politicians he hosted while in\nresidence, the house hosted countless other prominent\nfigures during the Civil War that included, amongst others,\nMajor General Pleasanton, General Lee, Brigadier General\nCuster, General James McDowell and President’s Polk and\nPierce (see Section 3.4).\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDuring the Civil War, Warrenton changed hands 67 times,\nsecond only to Winchester, Virginia, but after 1862 it was\nprimarily in Federal hands, with the nearby Rappahannock\nRiver serving as the dividing line between the forces.\nDuring the war the Town of Warrenton functioned as an\noccupied town with most of the large homes and churches\nwere used as hospitals by both sides when they were in\ncontrol of the area. During this time Monte Rosa housed\nthe leadership of the occupying force at the time and\nserved as a command center from which war efforts were\ndirected and troops dispatched. Both Union and\nConfederate troops camped on the grounds of Monte Rosa\nas their leaders stayed in more welcoming\naccommodations at Monte Rosa.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn a 1919 article in the Town & Country Almanac and\nHandbook of Information published by Joseph A. Jefferies\nabout Monte Rosa, Mr. Jefferies recognizes the historical\nimportance of Monte Rosa and muses, I like to think of the\nmany distinguished guests who have been entertained at\n“Monte Rosa,” later “Neptune Lodge” and have enjoyed its\natmosphere, its history and great attraction...I also like to\nthink of the many more who undoubtedly will enjoy the\ngenerous hospitality of its present owner, for it is well\nknown that Neptune Lodge has fallen into hands that will cherish its history and value it for all\nthat it stands for.\n</p>\n3 PICS OF SOLDIERS\n2 PICS OF INSIDE WALL\n\t\t<Link to=\"/\">Go back to the homepage</Link>\n\t</>\n);\n\nexport default Structures;\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n\t{\n\t\tsite {\n\t\t\tbuildTime(formatString: \"YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm a z\")\n\t\t}\n\t}\n`;\n","import React from \"react\"\nimport { useStaticQuery, graphql } from \"gatsby\"\nimport Img from \"gatsby-image\"\n\n/*\n * This component is built using `gatsby-image` to automatically serve optimized\n * images with lazy loading and reduced file sizes.
