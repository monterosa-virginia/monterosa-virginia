The Fauquier Democrat, November 24, 1949)</p><p><em>I have a photograph taken about 1890 of the present distinguished home of Hubert B. Phipps1 (#sdfootnote1sym)* on Culpeper Street, now known as “Neptune Lodge.”</em></p><p><em>Neptune Lodge stands on land which is part of a very large tract owned in the early eighteenth century by Thomas Lee, the whole having been granted to him when he was acting Governor of Virginia.</em></p><p><em>The first conveyance of record in Fauquier County with respect to this land was dated September 10, 1768, from John Lee, of the “Parish of Overwharton, in the County of Westmoreland.” The property continued for many years in the possession and ownership of the Lee family.</em></p><p><em>Robert E. Lee, son of Charles Lee, who was Attorney General of the United States in the cabinet of George Washington, was killed “in a street duel in the Town of Warrenton by one Charles Moore,” after making conveyance of part of the property (200 acres) to Governor William Smith (known as “Extra Billy” Smith) in 1833.</em></p><p><em>According to local authority the place, once known as “Monte Rosa”, remained in the Smith family until Miss Mary Amelia Smith, daughter of Governor Smith, who inherited it in 1871 from her mother,</em></p><p>1 (#sdfootnote1anc) Now owned by a syndicate headed by Laurens M. Hamilton of Warrenton; perhaps to become as exclusive club.</p><p><em>sold it in 1890 as containing 220 acres to the East Virginia Mineral and Warrenton Improvements Company. James K. Maddox purchased it the 16th day of September, 1895, from that company, changed the name to Neptune Lodge in honor of a famous horse he had. He made improvements outside, which removed the small porch with high steps, lowered the entrance to the ground floor, and also remodeled it extensively inside.</em></p><p><em>At the death of Mr. Maddux, in October 1930, the property passed to his daughter, Miss Winifred May Maddux, for whose account it was sold to the Robert T. Pells, who resided at Neptune a short while. The property then was purchased by Mr. Phipps who is today owner of the handsome estate, part of which is in the town limits and a part of which is just beyond.</em></p><p><em>As small children when we were brought to Warrenton by our parents for the summer we were taken out to “Monte Rosa” when it was the home of Miss Amelia Smith, to call on the venerable old lady, who in our mind really represented the entire Confederacy. Led up those steps on occasion in our “best bib and tucker”, it’s all a very faint memory, but that memory is the first of the lovely place, when it appeared as it does in the photograph. The house according to local notes was built in 1845.</em></p><p><em>The extensive brick stables at Neptune Lodge were built during the ownership of Governor Smith and I have always heard were used as a relay stop for the stage line which went from Milledgeville, Ga., to Washington, D.C.</em></p><p><em>The stables have long been an attraction to the property, as well as the large paddock, and back in the early 1900’s the paddock was the scene of many delightful entertainments of all kinds. I think I heard that the stables antedated the house, but somehow I doubt this.</em></p><p><em>renton Hunt, (organize in 1887 and one of the oldest of the Northern Virginia Hunts), and a gay and attractive scene it was too. With the stables of mellowed yellow-pink brick as a background, I have seen often well over a hundred riders move off behind their Master from that paddock, pink coats leading the way for the fox hunters.</em></p><p><em>I also remember Paddock Teas and Tournaments in the place and always a sleek horse or two grazing.</em></p><p><em>Neptune Lodge is one of Warrenton’s truly handsome as well as historical places. It has ever been a show place. It has known many lavish entertainments from its infancy. Shrove Tuesday evening, in the winter of 1921, when Mr. Maddux was entertaining a chosen few, one of the quests discovered the place a-fire. However, the Warrenton Volunteer Fire Company, abetted by many who were attending a party at the Warrenton Country Club given by Mrs. Frederick Kohl, had the fire out and while the upper floors of the place suffered some damage, Mr. Maddux shortly after had all trace of the conflagration removed and the perfect condition in which Neptune Lodge was kept, was restored. I once heard a lady who should know say there were dinner parties and dinner parties, but none ever to surpass Mr. Maddux’s parties at Neptune Lodge.</em></p><p><em>Mr. Phipps has further improved the place since he acquired it. The restoration of the old stone wall about the place pleased me as much as anything else done to it.</em></p><p><em>In the rear of the large stables Mr. Phipps has erected a sales pavilion where many cattle sales and meetings are held. This has in no wise detracted from the estate and has only served to make it more popular in the community and of more service to many.</em></p><p><em>Neptune Lodge has a notable background and one of which it may be proud. The original tract, like all of Fauquier, was a part of Richmond County, and subsequently a part of King George, then Westmoreland, Stafford and Prince William successively, Fauquier finally being cut off from Prince William, which explains the early reference to the first conveyance reading “in the county of Westmoreland.”</em></p><p><em>ed at “Monte Rosa” by Congressman Smith, later to become Governor, when he lived in what must have then been considered the palatial home; I feel sure States Rights, slavery, no doubt Lee and Jackson too were often talked of when it was the home of Miss Mary Amelia Smith….I like to think it was possible at Neptune Lodge over that handsome antique mahogany dining table that the internationally known sportsman and former Master of the Fox Hounds of the Warrenton Hunt, talked over with the late Sam Riddle, Philadelphia sportsman and his close friend, the purchase of Man ‘O War as a two year old for I have always heard it was upon Mr. Maddux’s advice that Riddle bought the famous “Old Red.” No doubt affairs of state were again discussed when the Pells were making it their home for I recall that Mr. Pell was connected with the State Department during World War II.</em></p><p><em>I like to think of the many distinguished guests who have been entertained at “Monte Rosa,” later “Neptune Lodge” and have enjoyed its atmosphere, its history and great attraction…I also like to think of the many more who undoubtedly will enjoy the generous hospitality of its present owner, for it is well known that Neptune Lodge has fallen into hands that will cherish its history and value it for all that it stands for.</em></p></div></div></main><footer style="margin-top:2rem">© <!-- -->2020</footer></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/section/postbellum-life";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-8d563e1c23881e77ed5b.js"],"app":["/app-db5736af57d561b64765.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-8bc5d0268685520d20e9.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-fe3bd95b1d0ffa7e0fea.js"],"component---src-pages-page-2-js":["/component---src-pages-page-2-js-d32763687b5cd9901fc6.js"],"component---src-pages-structures-tsx":["/component---src-pages-structures-tsx-55bf8444fe4a86e278e9.js"],"component---src-templates-section-js":["/component---src-templates-section-js-aac85eac04575e8c5a9b.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-8d563e1c23881e77ed5b.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-a7a7268c59029c7e92ed.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-db5736af57d561b64765.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-e2d419ac45d8ae41957a.js" async=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-section-js-aac85eac04575e8c5a9b.js" async=""></script><script src="/styles-755093da0c07f4b49226.js" async=""></script></body></html>
